&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aHoisting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add blank space in React js, you can use this code &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;React.Fragment&gt;&lt;/code&gt; . It will add blank space in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you, how to add blank space in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install and create a new React app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import react component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Install and create a new React app.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you have to install the React project. You should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; command to create a new React project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;npx create&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;react&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;app my&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;app
cd my&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;app
npm start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Import react component.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing, you have to import your React component. To do this, add the following line to the top of your component file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Create a Component..&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;React.Fragment&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and add black space in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;aHoisting&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Fragment&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos; &apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Space here */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Fragment&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;aHoisting&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Define the blank space example.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below code is an example of a React. You have to import &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React&lt;/code&gt;. and use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;React.Fragment&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to add blank space in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;MyComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;aHoisting&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Fragment&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos; &apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Space here */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Fragment&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;aHoisting&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; MyComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above code example, I have used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; component and add blank space in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the output of the above code example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aHoisting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add background color in React js, you can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;style={{ backgroundColor: &apos;pink&apos; }}&lt;/code&gt;. It will add background color in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you, how to add background color in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install and create a new React app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import react component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Install and create a new React app.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you have to install the React project. You should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; command to create a new React project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;npx create&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;react&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;app my&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;app
cd my&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;app
npm start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Import react component.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing, you have to import your React component. To do this, add the following line to the top of your component file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Create a Component.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use inline css &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;style={{ backgroundColor: &apos;pink&apos; }}&lt;/code&gt; then add background color in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;pink&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 aHoisting
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Define the background color example.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below code is an example of a background color. You have to import &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React&lt;/code&gt;. and use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;style={{ backgroundColor: &apos;pink&apos; }}&lt;/code&gt; to add background color in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;BackgroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;pink&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      aHoisting
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; BackgroundColor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above code example, I have used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React&lt;/code&gt; component and add background color in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the output of the above code example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aHoisting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make mui table with no data found in React js, you can use this code &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data.length &gt; 0&lt;/code&gt; . It will make mui table with no data found in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you, how to make mui table with no data found in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Material-UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import the required Material-UI components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the table body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Install Material-UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the following packages to use make mui table with no data found in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;npm install @mui&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;material @emotion&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;react @emotion&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;styled
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;yarn add @mui&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;material @emotion&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;react @emotion&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;styled
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Import the required Material-UI components.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make mui table with no data found in React, first, you have to import the table. We have imported the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;table&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tableBody&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tableCell&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tableContainer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tableHead&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tableRow&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Paper&lt;/code&gt; components from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@mui/material&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; DataTable &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./DataTable&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; Table&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; TableBody&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; TableCell&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; TableContainer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; TableHead&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; TableRow&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Paper&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Typography &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;@mui/material&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Define the table body.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table body is needed after table head, This code creates a table body with one row for each object in the rows array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;TableBody&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;TableRow key&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;TableCell&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;column1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;TableCell&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;TableCell&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;column2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;TableCell&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Add more table cells if needed */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;TableRow&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;TableBody&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MUI material make mui table with no data found example.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below code is an example of a Material UI table. You have to import &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@mui material&lt;/code&gt; table. In the Material Table function when you create a table component, it consists of a table head and a table body. In this code, we create our TableContainer component with a Paper component as its child and use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data.length &gt; 0 &lt;/code&gt; to make mui table with no data found in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; DataTable &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./DataTable&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Your data array&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;DataTable data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; App&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;DataTable.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above code example, I have used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@mui/material&lt;/code&gt; component and made mui table with no data found in react js.&lt;/p&gt;
